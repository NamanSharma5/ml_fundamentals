The point of this repo is to show how gradients can be calculated from any node in an expression tree, inspired by https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd

TODO:
 - compare efficieny and precision of implementations:
 -- my representation
 -- karpathy's micrograd
 -- pytorch
 -- C++ my representation
 ... ?
